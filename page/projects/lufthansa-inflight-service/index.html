                    <p>Lufthansa was looking for leveraging their inflight entertainment app to reconnect with their passengers.</p>
                    <p class="fs-l"><u>Problem:</u> Due to the pandemic, direct interaction and communication between passengers and the cabin crew is very limited. It is hard for the cabin crew to stay in a close connection with the customers also due to wearing a mask. Further, magazines and printed matter are removed from the seats due to hygiene guidelines and risk reduction. All in all, resulting in a more stressful journey and a feeling of uncertainty.</p>
                    <p class="fs-l"><u>Goal:</u> Reduce stress of passengers and cabin crew (during the pandemic) and create a sense of security, comfort and confidence for flying with Lufhansa.</p>
                    <p class="fs-l"><u>Challenge:</u> How should the (Covid) passsenger journey look like in order order to make the traveller feel comfortable about flying with Lufthansa?</p>

                    <p class="fs-l"><u>Social, organizational and physical environment:</u> The users are mostly already at the airport or on the plane. Due to social distancing, they might be seated apart from each other but are able to communicate through the app. To connect with the inflight service and airplane screen, wifi is necessary.</p>
                    <p class="fs-l"><u>Equipment used for task completion:</u> A smartphone with wifi is required. For using the entertainment services, headphones would be recommended. Additionally, for using miles&more or buy items through the deals catalogue, as well as ordering paid meals, payment details, such as a credit card, are required.</p>
