                    <p>Lufthansa was looking for leveraging their inflight entertainment app to reconnect with their passengers.</p>
                    <p><u>Problem:</u> Due to the pandemic, direct interaction and communication between passengers and the cabin crew is very limited. It is hard for the cabin crew to stay in a close connection with the customers also due to wearing a mask. Further, magazines and printed matter are removed from the seats due to hygiene guidelines and risk reduction. All in all, resulting in a more stressful journey and a feeling of uncertainty.</p>
                    <p><u>Goal:</u> Reduce stress of passengers and cabin crew (during the pandemic) and create a sense of security, comfort and confidence for flying with Lufhansa.</p>
                    <p><u>Challenge:</u> How should the (Covid) passsenger journey look like in order order to make the traveller feel comfortable about flying with Lufthansa?</p>
